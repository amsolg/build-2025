# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Announcement

## Date
2025-05-21

## Overview
At Microsoft Build 2025, Microsoft introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a groundbreaking standard for connecting AI agents with external data sources and tools. MCP enables secure, scalable integration between AI models and enterprise systems, allowing AI agents to access contextual information while maintaining proper security controls and permissions.

## Details
- **Universal Integration Standard:** MCP provides a standardized protocol for AI agents to connect with external data sources, APIs, and enterprise systems.
- **Security Framework:** Built-in security controls ensure AI agents operate within defined permissions and access boundaries, with enterprise-grade authentication and authorization.
- **Enterprise Integration:** Seamless integration with existing enterprise tools, databases, and workflows without compromising security or compliance requirements.
- **Developer-Configured Servers:** MCP servers can be configured by developers to provide controlled access to specific data sources and capabilities.
- **Isolated Operations:** AI agents operate in isolated environments with controlled access to resources, ensuring safe and predictable behavior.
- **Extensible Architecture:** The protocol is designed to be extensible, allowing organizations to build custom integrations and connectors for their specific needs.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** MCP works across different AI platforms and development environments, providing a consistent integration experience.
- **Tool Integration:** Enables AI agents to use external tools and services while maintaining proper audit trails and access controls.
