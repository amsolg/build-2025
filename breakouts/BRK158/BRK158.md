# BRK158 - Building Agents in Copilot Studio using Model Context Protocol, Open Standards, and More

## Date & Time

## Speakers
- Zankar Desai, Program Manager, Copilot Studio
- Mads Bolaris, Copilot Studio

## Executive Summary
This session introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard that enables LLM-powered agents to connect seamlessly with external tools and data sources. Attendees learned how MCP standardizes function invocation (search, co-generation, domain-specific actions) through a consistent JSON-over-HTTP interface. The integration with Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry was demonstrated, showing how developers can build sophisticated agent workflows, leverage custom model endpoints, and orchestrate multi-step processes. A live demo highlighted a document summarization agent using MCP, while a Zapier integration illustrated extending agents to third-party services. Key considerations for security, compliance, and best practices were discussed.

## Key Topics Covered
- MCP Architecture: hosts (VS Code, Copilot Studio), clients, and tool servers
- Standardized function invocation using JSON schemas and HTTP
- Integration with Azure AI Foundry for custom model access
- Extensibility via Zapier for third-party workflow orchestration
- Design patterns: context management, error handling, multi-tool chains
- Security and compliance: authentication, encryption, audit trails
- Demo: building and deploying a summarization agent in Copilot Studio
