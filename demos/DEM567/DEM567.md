# DEM567 - Executive Summary

## Date
2025-05-21

## Overview
This demo at Microsoft Build 2025 showcased how Azure Cosmos DB enables smarter and more intuitive information discovery in AI applications and analytics. The session focused on balancing accuracy and speed using full-text search for precise keyword matching, vector search for semantic understanding, and hybrid search that combines both approaches for enhanced relevance and contextual accuracy.

## Key Features Demonstrated
- Full-text search for precise keyword matching
- Vector search for semantic understanding and meaning-based queries
- Hybrid search combining vector and full-text for optimal relevance
- Scalability to over 1 billion vectors with sub-100ms latency
- Cost-effective architecture and enterprise-grade reliability

## Executive Summary
The DEM567 session featured experts from the Azure Cosmos DB team, who demonstrated efficient strategies for implementing vector, full-text, and hybrid search functionalities in Cosmos DB. The databaseâ€™s built-in vector indexing and robust architecture allow it to handle complex search scenarios at scale, supporting over a billion vectors with low latency and up to 41x cost savings compared to alternatives. Recent enhancements include 5-nines availability, geo-replication, and fleet management for DB containers. The presenters emphasized technical best practices such as provisioning throughput, bulk execution for data ingestion, and leveraging auto-scaling and partition querying for superior performance. The hybrid search capability was highlighted for its flexibility, allowing users to tune queries for accuracy or latency. A live demo illustrated practical implementation, showing code and the impact of different settings on query performance.
