# App Modernization via Copilot

## Date
2025-05-26

## Overview
At Microsoft Build 2025, a significant enhancement to GitHub Copilot was announced focusing on application modernization capabilities. The new Copilot Agent Mode can now help developers upgrade frameworks and migrate on-premise applications to the cloud with minimal manual intervention, streamlining what has traditionally been a complex and time-consuming process.

## Details
- **Framework Upgrades**: Copilot can now assist with upgrading applications from older to newer frameworks, such as:
  - Java 8 to Java 21
  - .NET 6 to .NET 9
  - Other popular frameworks with similar version gaps
  
- **Migration Assistance**: Comprehensive support for moving on-premise applications to cloud environments with:
  - Code refactoring for cloud compatibility
  - Configuration transformation
  - Integration with cloud-native services

- **Intelligent Planning**: The agent creates a detailed plan for updating both:
  - Application code
  - Dependencies and related components
  
- **Adaptive Learning**: Copilot suggests fixes based on:
  - Common modernization patterns
  - Best practices for the target framework/environment
  - Learning from developer-made changes during the process

- **Seamless Workflow**: The modernization process is integrated into the developer's normal workflow, reducing context switching and cognitive load

## Technical Implementation
The app modernization capability leverages:
- Deep code analysis to understand application architecture
- Knowledge of framework-specific migration paths
- Pattern recognition from millions of similar migrations
- Intelligent dependency management to maintain compatibility
- Cloud platform best practices built into its recommendations

## Benefits
- **Reduced Time**: Modernization projects that would take weeks or months can be significantly accelerated
- **Decreased Risk**: Automated analysis helps identify potential issues before they become problems
- **Consistent Quality**: Standardized approach to modernization ensures best practices are followed
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Developers learn modern patterns through the suggestions and explanations provided
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower resource requirements for large-scale modernization initiatives

## Use Cases
- Legacy monolith to microservices transformation
- On-premise to cloud migration
- Framework version upgrades
- Technical debt reduction
- Codebase standardization
