# Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Date
2025-05-26

## Overview
A significant highlight of the Microsoft Build 2025 Opening Keynote was the introduction of multi-agent orchestration capabilities, representing the next evolution in AI-powered development. This framework allows multiple specialized AI agents to work together on complex tasks, with each agent handling specific aspects of the workflow according to its expertise.

## Details
- **Coordinated Agent Systems**: The ability to connect and coordinate multiple AI agents, each with specialized capabilities and roles.
- **Complex Workflow Support**: Enables sophisticated workflows where different agents handle different stages or aspects of development tasks.
- **Model Scaffolding**: Provides structure for agents to collaborate on building complex applications.
- **Stateful Applications**: Support for high-scale, stateful applications where agents maintain context across interactions.
- **Role Specialization**: Different agents for different roles (SRE, code review, deployment, etc.).

## Specialized Agent Types
The keynote highlighted several agent types that can work together:
- **SRE Agents**: Focused on system reliability and incident response
- **Development Agents**: Specialized in code generation and feature implementation
- **Review Agents**: Dedicated to code review and quality assurance
- **DevOps Agents**: Managing deployment and infrastructure
- **Security Agents**: Monitoring for vulnerabilities and compliance issues

## Technical Implementation
- **Shared Context**: Agents can share context and information between them
- **Workflow Definition**: Clear handoffs and transitions between agent responsibilities
- **State Management**: Persistent state across agent interactions
- **Secure Communication**: Protected information passing between agents
- **Human Oversight**: Configurable human approval points in the multi-agent workflow

## Example Workflow
As described in the keynote, a multi-agent workflow might include:
1. A user requests a new feature implementation
2. A planning agent breaks down the task and creates a development plan
3. A coding agent implements the feature following the plan
4. A testing agent validates the implementation
5. A review agent provides quality feedback
6. A deployment agent manages the release process
7. An SRE agent monitors for issues after deployment

## Benefits
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent can excel at its particular role
- **Parallel Processing**: Different agents can work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Complete Workflow Coverage**: End-to-end handling of complex development tasks
- **Scalability**: Ability to tackle larger, more complex projects
- **Consistent Quality**: Standardized approach across different workflow stages

## Future Vision
- The keynote emphasized that multi-agent orchestration represents the future of building agentic applications
- Developers are encouraged to leverage these new tools and workflows
- Microsoft is committed to providing the infrastructure and frameworks to support multi-agent systems
- This approach will enable production-grade, stateful, agentic applications at scale
