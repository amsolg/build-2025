# File Analysis & Planning

## Date
2025-05-27

## Overview
During the Day Two Keynote at Microsoft Build 2025, Jay Parikh and other presenters demonstrated sophisticated file analysis and planning capabilities of Microsoft's AI tools. This technology enables AI to understand complex codebases, analyze multiple files simultaneously, and develop coherent action plans for code modifications or feature implementations.

## Details
- **Multi-file Analysis**: The demonstration showed AI tools examining various files across a codebase:
  - "You can see that it's looking at different files here."
  - The system analyzed relationships between files to understand the broader context
  - Both code and configuration files were included in the analysis

- **Automated Planning**:
  - "It's coming up with a plan for what it needs to do to go change here."
  - The AI created a structured approach for implementing required changes
  - The plan included steps, dependencies, and potential risks

- **Java File Processing**:
  - "You can see, hey, look, there's a couple of Java files here."
  - The demonstration specifically showed the tool examining Java source code
  - The AI understood Java-specific syntax and architectural patterns

- **Code Context Understanding**:
  - The system demonstrated an ability to grasp the purpose and function of code
  - It identified relevant sections that required modification
  - The AI recognized architectural patterns and code organization

## Technical Implementation
The keynote showed how the AI system:
- Parses and analyzes code structure across multiple files
- Builds a dependency graph to understand relationships
- Identifies affected areas when changes are proposed
- Generates an execution plan that respects code architecture
- Prioritizes changes based on dependencies and impact

## Presenter Interactions
During this segment:
- Jay Parikh narrated the AI's analysis process
- Jessica Deen responded with acknowledgment ("Okay")
- The presenters highlighted key moments in the analysis workflow
- They explained the significance of the AI's planning capabilities

## Real-world Applications
The demonstrated technology enables:
- Faster onboarding to unfamiliar codebases
- More accurate assessment of change impacts
- Reduced risk when implementing new features
- Improved planning for complex code modifications
- Better understanding of technical debt and architecture

## Benefits for Developers
This capability provides significant advantages:
- Reduced time spent manually traversing code to understand relationships
- More comprehensive impact analysis before making changes
- Decreased likelihood of unintended consequences from code modifications
- Improved planning efficiency for complex development tasks

## Integration with Development Tools
The demonstration showed this capability working within:
- Integrated development environments
- Version control systems
- Project management frameworks
- Existing developer workflows
