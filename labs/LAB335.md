# LAB335 - Build Your First Agentic RAG Solution with Azure AI Search

## Date
2025-05-19

## Overview
LAB335 provided hands-on experience building a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution using Azure AI Search and OpenAI services. This lab demonstrated how to create intelligent agents that can reason over organizational data, providing accurate, contextual responses while maintaining data security and governance. Attendees learned to build agentic RAG systems that go beyond simple retrieval to include planning, reasoning, and multi-step problem solving.
